export const displayStringList = (stringList) => {
  /*
        Write a function to take a list of strings
        e.g. ['one', 'two', 'three']
        and display it line per line with -> next to it
        e.g.
        -> one
        -> two
        -> three

        When a list is nested it should have an additional dash representing the level
        e.g. ['one', 'two', ['three']] becomes
        -> one
        -> two
        --> three
